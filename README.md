===================================================================
                 Welcome to data.py! (v 1.0)
A Python program that manages data file for anime encoding process.
===================================================================
```

## Synopsis 
This is a simple Python program that I wrote during the winter break of 2016. 
It can manage (read/write) data using a data file (which is a text file ending with
' _datafile.txt') in the current directory. 

## Motivation
I wrote this program to replace a Windows batch file used in my anime encoding process.
It was also a good exercise for me to learn Python, file input/output etc.

## Testing 
Make sure you have **Python 3.5** or higher installed. 

### On Mac
* Download data.py
* Use Terminal to go to the folder where data.py is located.
```bash
cd ~/.../Folder_that_contains_data_py/
```
* Launch data.py using Python 3.
```bash
Python3 data.py
```
### On Windows
* Download data.py
* Use cmd to go to the folder where data.py is located.
```bash
